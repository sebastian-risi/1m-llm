      "[Cognitive Psychology] Adaptive Route Guidance via Predictive Attention\n\nThis research investigates how visual attention shifts during route navigation, and how this shifts can be leveraged to improve route adherence and reduce cognitive load. It will develop a system that analyzes visual attention patterns (using eye-tracking) and dynamically adjusts route recommendations to capitalize on periods of heightened attention, promoting more consistent route following. Data will include eye-tracking data, route tracking data, and user-reported attention levels. Evaluation will be based on subjective user ratings of route adherence and perceived cognitive effort.",
      "[HCI] Dynamic Route Adaptation via Predictive Motion Analysis\n\nThis research investigates a system that uses predictive motion analysis to dynamically adjust route recommendations in real-time, based on the user\u2019s observed gait and anticipated movement patterns. It leverages a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope data to forecast the user\u2019s next steps, offering a more personalized and proactive navigation experience. We will evaluate the system\u2019s effectiveness through a series of controlled trials with diverse user groups, measuring metrics such as route completion time, user satisfaction, and adherence to preferred navigation styles.",

      "[NLP] Visual-Textual Sentiment Alignment for Crisis Prediction\n\nThis research will develop a system that aligns visual and textual sentiment expressed in social media posts with a specific crisis event, using a transformer model to identify correlations between image and text cues. The system will leverage a dataset of social media posts and corresponding images, and evaluate performance using a custom metric combining precision and recall on crisis prediction tasks.",
      "[NLP] Dynamic Crisis Prediction via Multi-Modal Sentiment Fusion\nThis research will develop a system that predicts potential crises by fusing sentiment analysis from social media posts with visual cues (e.g., image analysis) and textual context, leveraging a transformer model to dynamically adjust the weighting of each modality. Evaluation will be based on precision and recall for identifying emerging crisis indicators, as well as a user-defined metric of time to detection.",

      "[NLP] Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Act Selection\n\nThis research explores using reinforcement learning to dynamically select dialogue acts from a set of possible responses, optimizing for user engagement and task completion. It builds upon the existing work of selecting responses based on keywords and sentiment analysis, but instead of relying on pre-defined rules, it trains an agent to learn optimal action sequences through trial and error, evaluating performance based on user feedback and task success rates. Data: A dataset of multi-turn conversations with user feedback and task completion labels. Evaluation: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and user satisfaction scores.",

      "[Safety] Algorithmic Bias Detection in Autonomous Vehicle Perception Systems\n\nThis research will develop a novel framework for detecting and quantifying algorithmic bias in pedestrian detection models used by autonomous vehicles. The framework will leverage a combination of adversarial training and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify disparities in detection rates across demographic groups (e.g., based on age, race, and gender). We will evaluate the framework using a publicly available dataset of pedestrian images and metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, focusing on identifying patterns indicative of biased model behavior."
