      "[Evaluation] Dynamic Attention Network for Visual Scene Understanding\n\nThis research explores a novel dynamic attention mechanism for visual scene understanding, aiming to improve performance on complex scenes with occlusions and varying object scales. The idea involves extending the standard self-attention mechanism to incorporate a \"contextual memory\" layer that dynamically adjusts the attention weights based on recent visual input. We will evaluate the network on a dataset of human-annotated scenes with varying levels of occlusion and object scale using metrics like Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and a custom metric measuring the accuracy of object segmentation.",

      "[Cognitive Science] Exploring the Role of Predictive Coding in Social Memory Consolidation\n\nThis research investigates how predictive coding mechanisms influence the consolidation of social memories \u2013 memories of interactions with others. I will build a simulated environment where participants are presented with a series of social interactions, and then receive a \"prediction\" of the likely outcome of the interaction.  The goal is to determine if participants exhibit increased memory consolidation when they receive a more accurate prediction, compared to a less accurate one. Data will include EEG recordings to measure neural activity associated with prediction and consolidation, and a subjective rating of memory recall accuracy. Metrics will include accuracy of recall and subjective ratings of emotional intensity.",

I will build a system that identifies when a user consistently receives recommendations that are highly similar to those they\u2019ve previously engaged with, even if those recommendations are not explicitly biased. Data will include user interaction history, item metadata, and a measure of similarity between items. Evaluation will involve comparing the system\u2019s detection rate to human annotators and assessing the impact on user satisfaction.",
